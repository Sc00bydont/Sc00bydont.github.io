        <h1>Kurt Dillon is a Fraudster</h1>

    <main>
        <h2>I created this website to honor Kurt Dillon and all his autobiographical accolades</h2>
        <p>Kurt enjoys publishing true crime podcasts and writing about crime. He has eight children. He claims to be a retired major from the military and to possess multiple master's degrees. He is an editor for Illumination who attempts to filter out most ideologies that are not aligned with his far-right own.

<p>Upon researching his LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and Medium profiles, I can find no such evidence of any military affiliation or work as an English instructor with thirty-plus years of experience.

That is not because he fails to share personal information or photos of his work endeavors and family without limiting the public audience, but because no such photos or affiliations exist. </p><p>He does, however, have photos of himself committing real estate fraud in an attempt to look professional.

    </p><p>I also took it upon myself to research his criminal background, and what I found was multiple felonies in public records. I found multiple convictions from many different states, and multiple evictions from many different residences across the United States.

Here is a link to one such fraud case: <a href="https://casetext.com/case/us-v-dillon-5">US-V-Dillon</a>
        </p>
        <p>Here are some screenshots of some of his past crimes I pulled from a deep search. I was sure to check the case numbers in state registries as well.</p><br>
        <img src="screenshot23.png" width="300px" height="300px"/>
    <p>On his LinkedIn account, he claims to have two master's degrees but fails to mention his status as a retired major in the military. I have requested verification from the National Personnel Records Center for verification of Kurt Joseph Dillon’s time in service. Although he never mentions which branch he served in on any social platform, I took a guess with other information upon making the records request. I do not expect them to get back with my request with any substantial information.

</p><p></p>On his Facebook, he mentions he is a retired Major, but makes no mention of degrees, so again there is a disparity.

</p><p></p>On his Twitter account, he shares quotes along the lines of, “In honor of the Friday the 13th Jihad tomorrow, I will be loading my 45 and my 9mm with rounds coated with pork chop grease. Come get some.”

</p><p></p>On his Podcasts, he enjoys trying to disprove fact-check websites such as Snopes.com. His far-right mannerisms are easy to detect for anyone who has been alive for a couple of days. </p>
