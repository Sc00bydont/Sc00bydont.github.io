        <h2>I created this website to honor Kurt Dillon and all his autobiographical accolades</h2>
        <p>Kurt enjoys publishing true crime podcasts and writing about crime. He has eight children. He claims to be a retired major from the military and to possess multiple master's degrees. He is an editor for Illumination who attempts to filter out most ideologies that are not aligned with his far-right own.

Upon researching his LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and Medium profiles, I can find no such evidence of any military affiliation or work as an English instructor with thirty-plus years of experience.

That is not because he fails to share personal information or photos of his work endeavors and family without limiting the public audience, but because no such photos or affiliations exist. He does, however, have photos of himself committing real estate fraud in an attempt to look professional.

I also took it upon myself to research his criminal background, and what I found was multiple felonies in public records. I found multiple convictions from many different states, and multiple evictions from many different residences across the United States.

Here is a link to one such fraud case:
