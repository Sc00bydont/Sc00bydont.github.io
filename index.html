        <h2>I created this website to honor Kurt Dillon and all his autobiographical accolades</h2>
        <p>I've been woodworking for 20 years now. I started young, and I was taught by my father. He taught me carpentry and how to work with
                    the tools in his shop. I picked up the trade after his passing, but I focused more on making art pieces because it allows me to be creative. 
                    My creative niche is what fueled me to design this web page. I thrive on perfection, and I have an eye for detail. I hunt down website bugs
                    like ghost busters hunt ghosts. "I ain't afraid of no ghost." I am in school for my BSSE, and my schooling is paid for by the GI Bill because I am a veteran. 
                    I hope you enjoy my page.
